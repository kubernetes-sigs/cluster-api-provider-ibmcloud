# Kubernetes Cluster API Provider IBM Cloud

<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api"><img src="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/raw/master/logo/logo.png"  width="100"></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/"><img hspace="90px" src="./docs/images/ibm-cloud.svg" alt="Powered by IBM Cloud" height="100"></a>

------

This repository hosts a concrete implementation of an IBM Cloud provider for the [cluster-api project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api).

## What is the Cluster API Provider IBM Cloud

The [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) brings declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and management. The API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing for true IBM Cloud hybrid deployments of Kubernetes.

### Code of conduct

Participation in the Kubernetes community is governed by the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

------

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install `kubectl` (see [here](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/)). Because `kustomize` was included into `kubectl` and it's used by `cluster-api-provider-ibmcloud` in generating yaml files, so version `1.14.0+` of `kubectl` is required, see [integrate kustomize into kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/633) for more info.
2. You can use either VM, container or existing Kubernetes cluster act as bootstrap cluster.
   - If you want to use container, install [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind#installation-and-usage). This is preferred.
   - If you want to use VM, install [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/), version 0.30.0 or greater.
   - If you want to use existing Kubernetes cluster, prepare your kubeconfig.
3. Install a [driver](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/docs/drivers.md) **if you are using minikube**. For Linux, we recommend kvm2. For MacOS, we recommend VirtualBox.
4. An appropriately configured [Go development environment](https://golang.org/doc/install)
5. Build the `clusterctl` tool

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-ibmcloud $GOPATH/src/sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api-provider-ibmcloud
   cd $GOPATH/src/sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api-provider-ibmcloud/cmd/clusterctl
   go build
   ```

### Cluster Creation

1. Create the `cluster.yaml`, `machines.yaml`, `provider-components.yaml`, and `addons.yaml` files if needed. 

   ```bash
   cd examples/ibmcloud
   ./generate-yaml.sh [options] <path/to/clouds.yaml> <provider os: [centos,ubuntu,coreos]>
   cd ../..
   ```

   `<clouds.yaml>` is a yaml file to record how to interact with IBM Cloud, there's a sample
   [clouds.yaml](cmd/clusterctl/examples/ibmcloud/clouds.yaml.template).

   `<provider os>` specifies the operating system of the virtual machines Kubernetes will run on.
   Supported Operating Systems:
   - `ubuntu`
   - `centos` (Not Implemented)
   - `coreos` (Not Implemented)

   #### Quick notes on clouds.yaml
   ```shell
   $ cat clouds.yaml
   clouds:
    ibmcloud:
      auth:
        apiUserName: "Your API Username"
        authenticationKey: "Your API Authentication Key"
   ```

   You can get `apiUserName` and `authenticationKey` from https://control.softlayer.com/ .
   - Logon to https://control.softlayer.com/ .
   - Click your user name on the right top of the console.
   ![ibmcloud account](docs/images/ibmcloud-account.png)
   - The console will navigate you to the page of `Edit User Profile`.
   ![ibmcloud profile](docs/images/ibmcloud-profile.png)
   - Scroll down the page to the bottom, you will see a section `API Access Information`. You can get `apiUserName` and `authenticationKey` from there.
   ![ibmcloud auth](docs/images/ibmcloud-auth.png)

   #### Special notes on ssh keys and fetching `admin.conf`

   In order to allow `clusterctl` to fetch Kubernetes' `admin.conf` from the master node, you **must** manually create the key pair in IBM Cloud. By default the generated `machine.yaml` uses `cluster-api-provider-ibmcloud` to be the `sshKeyName`. However, you are free to change that.

   For the ssh key, you can logon to https://control.softlayer.com/ , click `Devices->Manage->SSH Keys`, you will be navigated to the page of `SSH Keys`, click `Add` to create your own key.
   ![ibmcloud key management](docs/images/ibmcloud-key.png)
   ![ibmcloud key add](docs/images/ibmcloud-addkey.png)

   ***NOTE*** The private key used to connect to the master node is by default (currently hardcoded) at `~/.ssh/id_ibmcloud`, so make sure you copy the generated key's private key info into this file.

   For the `sshUserName`, you can use `root` or `ubuntu` user for the `Ubuntu` cloud image, while you can only use `root` user for other Linux cloud images. By default the generated `machine.yaml` uses `root` to be the `sshUserName`. 

   Optionally, add a `addons.yaml` can provide additional add ons in target cluster, for example, download [k8s dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/master/aio/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml) and put into `examples/ibmcloud/out/addons.yaml` then add `-a examples/ibmcloud/out/addons.yaml` in `clusterctl` command, after cluster created:

   The dashboard pod will be created and user is able to logon through k8s dashboard:

```
# kubectl --kubeconfig=kubeconfig get pods --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE                  NAME                                          READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
...
kube-system                kubernetes-dashboard-5f7b999d65-ntrxb         1/1     Running            0          12m
...
```

2. Create a cluster:

You should review files `cluster.yaml` and `machines.yaml`, and ensure the `domain`, `dataCenter` and `osReferenceCode` are set. You can customize those values based on your requirement.

   - If you are using minikube:

   ```bash
   ./clusterctl create cluster --bootstrap-type minikube --bootstrap-flags kubernetes-version=v1.12.3 \
     --provider ibmcloud -c examples/ibmcloud/out/cluster.yaml \
     -m examples/ibmcloud/out/machines.yaml -p examples/ibmcloud/out/provider-components.yaml \
     -a examples/ibmcloud/out/addons.yaml
   ```

   To choose a specific minikube driver, please use the `--bootstrap-flags vm-driver=xxx` command line parameter. For example to use the kvm2 driver with clusterctl you woud add `--bootstrap-flags vm-driver=kvm2`, for linux, if you haven't installed any driver, you can add `--bootstrap-flags vm-driver=none`.

   - If you are using kind:

   ```bash
   ./clusterctl create cluster --bootstrap-type kind --provider ibmcloud \
     -c examples/ibmcloud/out/cluster.yaml -m examples/ibmcloud/out/machines.yaml \
     -p examples/ibmcloud/out/provider-components.yaml -a examples/ibmcloud/out/addons.yaml
   ```

   - If you are using existing Kubernetes cluster:
   ```bash
   ./clusterctl create cluster --bootstrap-cluster-kubeconfig ~/.kube/config \
     --provider ibmcloud -c examples/ibmcloud/out/cluster.yaml \
     -m examples/ibmcloud/out/machines.yaml -p examples/ibmcloud/out/provider-components.yaml \
     -a examples/ibmcloud/out/addons.yaml
   ```

   For the above command, the `bootstrap-cluster-kubeconfig` was located at `~/.kube/config`, you must update it
   to use your kubeconfig.

   Additional advanced flags can be found via help.

   ```bash
   ./clusterctl create cluster --help
   ```

### Interacting with your cluster

If you are using kind, config the `KUBECONFIG` first before using kubectl:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG="$(kind get kubeconfig-path --name="clusterapi")"
```

Once you have created a cluster, you can interact with the cluster and machine
resources using kubectl:

```bash
kubectl --kubeconfig=kubeconfig get clusters
kubectl --kubeconfig=kubeconfig get machines
kubectl --kubeconfig=kubeconfig get machines -o yaml
```

### Cluster Deletion

This guide explains how to delete all resources that were created as part of
your IBM Cloud Cluster API Kubernetes cluster.

1. Delete all of the node Machines in the cluster. Make sure to wait for the
  corresponding Nodes to be deleted before moving onto the next step. After this
  step, the master node will be the only remaining node.

   ```bash
   kubectl --kubeconfig=kubeconfig delete machines -l set=node
   kubectl --kubeconfig=kubeconfig get nodes
   ```

2. Delete the master machine.
    ```bash
    kubectl --kubeconfig=kubeconfig delete machines -l set=master
    ```

3. Delete the kubeconfig file that were created for your cluster.

   ```bash
   rm kubeconfig
   ```

4. Delete the ssh keypair that were created for your cluster machine.

   ```bash
   rm -rf $HOME/.ssh/id_ibmcloud*
   ```

### Create additional worker nodes

Please refer to [Create a new woker node](docs/add_node.md) for further info.

### Trouble shooting

Please refer to [Trouble shooting documentation](docs/trouble_shooting.md) for further info.
