# IBM Cloud
## How to set correct OS reference code in `machines.yaml`?
The value of `osReferenceCode` is from IBM Cloud. You can get an avalible value list by:
```bash
slcli virtual create-options
```
If you're using `ubuntu`, the value of name `os (UBUNTU)` lists all available OS reference code.
You can use the specific OS version for the `Machine` by configurating corresponding OS reference code.

Please refer to the [softlayer command line document](https://softlayer-api-python-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/)
for details in setting up `slcli`

## How to set `dataCenter` value in `machines.yaml`?
Like `osReferenceCode` above, you can also list available data center by using following command:
```bash
slcli virtual create-options
```

Then you can set `dataCenter` value by referring to the returned list.

## How to set `flavor` value in `machines.yaml`?
Like `osReferenceCode` above, you can also list available flavors by using following command:
```bash
slcli virtual create-options
```

Then you can set `flavor` value by referring to the returned list, for example, `B1_2X4X25`.
