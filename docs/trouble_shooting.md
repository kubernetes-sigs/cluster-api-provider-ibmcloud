# Trouble shooting

This guide (based on minikube and others should be similar) explains general info on how to debug issues if cluster failed to create.

## Get log of clusterapi-controller containers

1. Get ibmcloud container name, the output depends on the system you are running.
   the `minikube.kubeconfig` which is bootstrap cluster's kubeconfig by default locates at `cmd/clusterctl` folder.

   ```
   # kubectl --kubeconfig minikube.kubeconfig get pods -n ibmcloud-provider-system
   NAMESPACE                   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   ibmcloud-provider-system    clusterapi-controller-0                  1/1     Running   0          27m
   ```

2. Get log of clusterapi-controller-0

   ```
   # kubectl --kubeconfig minikube.kubeconfig log clusterapi-controller-0 -n ibmcloud-provider-system
   ```
