## IBM Cloud Machine Images for CAPIBM Clusters

CAPIBM requires a “machine image” containing pre-installed, matching versions of kubeadm and kubelet. Machine image is required during the cluster creation in the IBMVPCMachineTemplate and IBMPowerVSMachineTemplate spec.

Pre-built public Images are published by the maintainers regularly for each new Kubernetes version.
